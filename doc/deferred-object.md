<p>The Deferred object, introduced in jQuery 1.5, is a chainable utility object created by calling the <a href="/jQuery.Deferred/"><code>jQuery.Deferred()</code></a> method. It can register multiple callbacks into callback queues, invoke callback queues, and relay the success or failure state of any synchronous or asynchronous function.</p>
    <p>The Deferred object is chainable, similar to the way a jQuery object is chainable, but it has its own methods. After creating a Deferred object, you can use any of the methods below by either chaining directly from the object creation or saving the object in a variable and invoking one or more methods on that variable.</p>
